# Purpose

A simple web-site allowing a handful of editors to edit text elements via the web. 

## Comparison to WordPress, SiteJet, Website-builder, etc.

Those complex tools claim to give a user the ability to create websites with just a few clicks. Often the user is overwhelmed with a plentora of templates, which do not fit the purpose. Adapting the template requires a deep understanding how those tools work and that exceeds the knowledge of a common user.

## Approach

Writing text requires no more knowledge than Office Word requires.
